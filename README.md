## The intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) catalog for reverberation mapping

This catalog includes 985 broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) collected from previous literature (see references in the catalog).
We will keep it updated; the total number of targets will remain the same, with additional information appended.
