## The intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) catalog for reverberation mapping 

To fill the IMBH gap, we plan to conduct an IMBH-RM project to precisely measure the black hole masses of a dozen IMBH candidates. This catalog includes 985 broad-line IMBH candidates compiled from previous literature (see references in the catalog). We will keep it updated, with the total number of targets remaining unchanged and additional information appended.
